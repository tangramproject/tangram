For quick installation on Linux and macOS, execute the following command:

```shell
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tangramproject/tangram/master/install/install.sh)
```

The following parameters can be supplied:

#### Linux Only

`install.sh --runasuser <username> --runasgroup users`
Install as the current logged in user

`install.sh --upgrade --runasuser <username> --runasgroup users` Upgrades the node

#### Linux and macOS

`--no-service`
Do not install node as a service

`--noninteractive`
Assume default answers without user interaction.

`--uninstall`
Uninstall node

For example:

```shell
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tangramproject/tangram/master/install/install.sh) --uninstall
```

#### macOS Only

> In some cases, `macOS` users might need to install gmp. The secp256k1 library depends on gmp (arbitrary precision arithmetic).

For quick installation execute the following command:

`brew install gmp`

If you don't have homebrew installed:

### Installing Homebrew macOS

Users running Catalina, Mojave, or Big Sur, execute the following command if you don't have homebrew installed:

## What is Tangram
Tangram is a revolutionary cryptocurrency that transforms the way we transact. It's fast, fee-less, private and fungible, making it an ideal choice for blockchain transactions. The Tangram network uses a state-of-the-art Pure-Proof-Of-Stake (PPoS) consensus algorithm that is secure, energy-efficient, and decentralized.

Incorporating advanced cryptographic protocols like Bulletproofs, stealth addresses and RingCT for transaction mixing, Tangram guarantees that users can keep their identity and financial activities completely private.  Plus, its lightning-fast transaction speeds and zero fees make it the perfect choice for everyday payments.  

Tangram's PPoS consensus algorithm is specifically designed to ensure a fair distribution of rewards.  Whether it's a small stake or a large one, Tangram ensures that the rewards are distributed fairly to those who put their precious time and effort into staking.

## Security Warning
Tangram is the first release with consensus and should be treated as an experiment! There are no guarantees and we can expect flaws. Use it at your own risk.

## Whitepaper
New whitepaper coming soon&#8482;
